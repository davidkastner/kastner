The overarching direction of my thesis is to elucidate patterns governing substrate-protein relationships in high-valent enzymes. More specifically, I am interested in how the protein environment influences reactivity and substrate specificity in iron-containing enzymes. As it currently stands, my thesis direction can be broken down into three aims: 1) Elucidate the role of the active site and greater protein environment in mediating hydroxylase vs. halogenase reactivity in non-heme iron dioxygenases. 2) Investigate the role of electronic allostery, charge transfer, and electronic perturbations in mediating reactivity in iron-containing enzymes. 3) Leverage modern machine learning techniques to identify patterns in complex MD or multiscale QM/MM simulations.
